<p>Poori is a popular deep-fried Indian bread that is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Made with whole wheat flour, it is a staple in many Indian breakfasts and festive meals. Pooris puff up beautifully when fried and are best served hot with potato curry, chana masala, or sweet dishes like halwa. Their golden color and irresistible texture make them a favorite across all age groups.</p>
