    <p>Idly is a traditional South Indian breakfast dish known for its soft, fluffy texture and lightness. Made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram), idlies are steamed to perfection, making them not only delicious but also easy to digest. Often served with coconut chutney, tangy sambar, or spicy podi, idly offers a balanced and nutritious start to the day. Its simplicity, health benefits, and comforting taste have made it a favorite across India and even internationally.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Urad dal</li>
        <li>Idly rava</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps for  making</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 2 cups of rice and 1 cup of urad dal (split black gram) separately in water for about 4–6 hours.</li>
        <li>Grind the soaked urad dal into a smooth, fluffy paste. Then grind the rice to a slightly coarse texture. Mix both together, adding a little water if needed, to form a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Cover the batter and let it ferment in a warm place for 8–12 hours or overnight, until it rises and becomes slightly airy.</li>
        <li>Stir the fermented batter gently. Grease idly molds and pour the batter into them, filling each mold about ¾ full.</li>
        <li>Steam the idlies in an idly cooker or steamer for about 10–15 minutes. Let them cool slightly, then remove and serve with chutney and sambar.
